# clive
Deep-learning irc bot

This repository contains a Python script that implements a deep learning chatbot that can connect to an IRC channel and learn from its interactions with users.

Requirements

To run the script, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

-irc
-keras
-tensorflow

You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:

pip install irc keras tensorflow

Usage
To use the chatbot, you will need to run the clive.py script and follow the prompts to enter the necessary information. The script will generate a menu on first initialization that allows you to define the IRC server, channel, and chatbot nickname.

Once the chatbot is connected to the IRC channel, it will start listening for messages and responding to them using its deep learning model. The chatbot will learn from its interactions with users and improve its responses over time.
